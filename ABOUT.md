We believe in:
- 💙 **Radical Transparency** - All evidence is public
- ⚖️ **Verifiable Claims** - Every assertion is falsifiable
- 🛡️ **Cryptographic Proof** - Git commits anchor our timeline

## Why This Matters

### The Problem
AI systems are becoming more powerful, but governance mechanisms are theoretical. Most "AI safety" is:
- ❌ Marketing claims without proof
- ❌ Closed-source systems ("trust us")
- ❌ Academic research without implementation

### Our Solution
AOS is the **first production-ready constitutional AI system** with:
- ✅ **External validation** (ChatGPT audit)
- ✅ **Open evidence** (public repository)
- ✅ **Falsifiable claims** (verifiable timestamps)
- ✅ **Industry collaboration** (Anthropic + OpenAI + Google)

## Our Principles

### 1. Honesty as Strength
We publish **everything**—including our vulnerabilities, mistakes, and limitations. Transparency builds trust.

### 2. Verifiable Claims Only
Every date, timestamp, and achievement is **cryptographically anchored**. No unverifiable marketing speak.

### 3. Prior Art Transparency
We disclose our patent filings **before** they're granted, establishing clear priority dates for the research community.

### 4. Open Evidence
All audit materials, threat models, and security analysis are **public**. Anyone can verify our claims.

### 5. Collaborative Innovation
We work **with** the AI industry, not against it. Our goal is to raise the bar for everyone.
