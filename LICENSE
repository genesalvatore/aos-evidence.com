## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Academic Researcher

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Read documentation (CC BY 4.0 - free)
- ✅ Cite in papers (CC BY 4.0 - requires attribution)
- ✅ Study implementation (Apache 2.0 - free)
- ✅ Publish analysis (no patent license needed for research)

**Result:** Maximum academic engagement

### Scenario 2: Open-Source Hobbyist

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Read documentation (CC BY 4.0 - free)
- ✅ Experiment with code (Apache 2.0 - free)
- ✅ Share modifications (Apache 2.0 - free)

**Limitation:**
- ⚠️ Creating working implementation using patented methods → needs license

**Result:** Community experimentation without giving away patents

### Scenario 3: Enterprise Adopter

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Read documentation (CC BY 4.0 - free)
- ✅ Evaluate code (Apache 2.0 - free)
- ✅ Test in non-production environments

**To deploy in production:**
- 💰 Requires paid patent license

**Result:** Enterprise adoption with fair compensation

### Scenario 4: Competitor/Copycat

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Read documentation (CC BY 4.0 - free)
- ✅ Study code (Apache 2.0 - free)

**Limitation:**
- ❌ Implementing patented methods → patent infringement
- ⚠️ AOS can enforce patents

**Result:** Transparency doesn't mean free copying

## Why This License Structure?

### CC BY 4.0 for Documentation

- ✅ Gold standard for academic/research documentation
- ✅ Widely recognized in academia
- ✅ Compatible with journal/conference requirements
- ✅ Doesn't contaminate derivative works (no share-alike)
- ✅ Researchers can freely cite and build upon
- ✅ Transparent while protecting credit

### Apache 2.0 for Code

- ✅ Industry-standard open-source license
- ✅ Permissive (allows commercial evaluation)
- ✅ Explicit patent grant for the code itself
- ✅ Compatible with most other licenses
- ✅ Widely trusted by enterprises
- ✅ Encourages integration and experimentation

### Patent Carve-Out

- ✅ Maximizes transparency (open docs, open code)
- ✅ Protects IP (patents still enforceable)
- ✅ Enables research (researchers can study freely)
- ✅ Monetizes implementation (commercial users need license)
- ✅ Prevents copycat products while allowing learning
