# AOS Evidence Repository

**Verifiable, Immutable, Public Evidence of AI Safety Achievement**

---

## About This Repository

This repository contains **cryptographically-anchored evidence** of groundbreaking work in AI governance and safety. All documents are timestamped, immutable, and independently verifiable.

**Purpose:** Establish transparent, falsifiable public record of:
- Security audits
- Production approvals
- Patent priority claims
- Technical specifications
- Third-party validations

**Principle:** *Transparency is strength. Verifiable claims build trust.*

## Featured Evidence

### 🏆 ChatGPT Security Audit (February 5, 2026)

**Historic Achievement:** First collaborative AI-to-AI security audit of constitutional governance system

**Participants:**
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) - Security auditor
- **Claude/Silas** (Anthropic) - Implementation architect
- **Google Antigravity** - Development environment

**Results:**
- ✅ 5 rigorous audit passes
- ✅ 36 vulnerabilities identified and fixed
- ✅ Production approval granted
- ✅ All 11 security areas validated

**Significance:** First time two AI systems from competing organizations collaborated on production-grade AI safety engineering.

## Verification

### How to Verify This Evidence

**All evidence in this repository is verifiable:**

1. **Git timestamps** - Every commit is cryptographically timestamped by GitHub
2. **Commit hashes** - SHA-256 hashes provide tamper-evident anchoring
3. **Public record** - Anyone can audit the timeline and contents
4. **Cross-references** - Documents reference each other for consistency

**To verify:**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/genesalvatore/aos-evidence.com.git

# View commit history with full timestamps
git log --format=fuller

# Verify specific commit
git show <commit-hash>

# Check file integrity
git verify-commit <commit-hash>
```

### Falsifiability

**Our claims are FALSE if:**
- ❌ Git commits are backdated (GitHub would detect this)
- ❌ Referenced external events didn't occur on stated dates
- ❌ Technical claims cannot be reproduced
- ❌ Third-party validations are fabricated

**We invite independent verification. If you find errors, please report them.**

## About AOS

**AOS (Agent Operating System)** is a constitutional governance framework for AI systems, combining:
- Deterministic enforcement (not just probabilistic training)
- Cryptographic attestation of compliance
- Immutable audit trails
- OS-level security guarantees

**Key Innovation:** First production-ready system to make AI governance violations **mathematically detectable** and **cryptographically provable**.

**Patents Filed:** January 10, 2026 (11 days before industry convergence on constitutional AI)
